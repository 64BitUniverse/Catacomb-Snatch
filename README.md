**THIS IS NOT PLAYABLE**

The roadmap for what I'm doing!

- ☐ Full conversion to Unity
    - ☑️ Character can move
    - ☐ AI routing and scripts for moving mobs
    - ☐ Making the walls... walls
    - ☐ Tile randomazation
    - ☐ Making Rails connect to each other
    - ☐ Gun mechanics (Following your mouse, bouncy bullets, auto aim for phone users. If anyone knows a good way to do Raycast in 2D             Unity, hit me up)
    - ☐ Manual keybindings/Controller support
    
  ☑️ Texture thingies are done as far as I'm concerned.
    
If you would like to help with this, download this repo, unzip it, and open the Unity Hub. Press add, and locate where you unzipped the repo. If you are using Visual Studio, you'll need to go to Edit > Prefrences > External Tools > External Script Editor (It's the first one on the 'External Tools' page). Select 'Visual Studio (Whatever edition you have)', and now you are done with setup with Unity.

Tiled was used in the original Java game, and we are using it in this. You can download it at https://www.mapeditor.org/ . SuperTiled2Unity sbould automaticaly install, but if it doesn't it's linked below.

Unity version used: 2019.2.x (Will upadte to 2020 when it's out of beta, and then again to the LTS version of 2020)

I want to use 2D Pixel Perfect in this project to scale sprites depending on what device you use. It needs 2D IK, I think, but both Packages get installed automaticaly, and they are in the Package Manager if something goes wrong.
