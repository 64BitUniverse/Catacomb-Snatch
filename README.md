Catacomb Snatch Community Edition

The roadmap for what I'm doing!

☐ Full conversion to Unity
  - ☐ Converting Scripts
    - ☐ Getting scripts like GameManager working
    - ☐ Scripts for moving things
  - ☐ Texture thingies
    - ☑️ I figure out what each texture does. I think I know most of them, just not sure on a few.
    - ☐ Everything Animated
    - ☑️ Textures ready to go (Hopefuly. I at least split all of them using the built in Texture editor. I call that a win.)
    
If you would like to help with this, download this repo, unzip it, get rid of the travis file and readme if you want, and open the Unity Hub. Press add, and locate where you unzipped the repo and you are done.

Unity version used: 2019.2.15f1

I use 2D Pixel Perfect in this project, which needs 2D IK I think. You can find them in the Package Manager
