Catacomb Snatch Community Edition

The roadmap for what I'm doing!

☐ Full conversion to Unity
  - ☐ Converting Scripts
    - Specifics TBD. Focousing on textures. Easiest right now.
  - ☐ Texture thingies
    - ☐ I figure out what each texture does. I think I know most of them, just not sure on a few.
    - ☐ Everything Animated
    - ☑️ Textures ready to go (Hopefuly. I at least split all of them using the built in Texture editor. I call that a win.)
