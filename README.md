Right now on Godot 4.2. I'm using Steam to install Godot, so it may update unintentionally. I'll try my best to catch it before it updates.
Other software being used:
- Tiled to create maps
- Personally, Asprite to edit sprite sheets. Sprite sheets still png, so use whatever you want

#Notes
- Located in the TODO tab (Make sure the Simple TODO plugin is enabled in Project Settings)
