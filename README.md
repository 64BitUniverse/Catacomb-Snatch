##### Software I'm using
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 4.3 on Steam
- Using [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) to create maps
- Personally using [Asprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to edit sprite sheets. Sprite sheets still png, so use whatever you want. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free program with a pencil function. 

##### Notes
- My notes are located in the TODO tab (make sure the Simple TODO plugin is enabled in Project Settings). Since the whole project file is here in the repo, the notes should be here as well.
