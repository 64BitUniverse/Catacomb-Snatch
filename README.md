##### Software I'm using
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 4.4.1
- Using [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) to create maps
- Personally using [Asprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to edit sprite sheets. Sprite sheets still png, so use whatever you want. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free program with a pencil function.
